Your business:
{business_info}
- Amenities provided by your business:
{features_block}
- Menu items and prices:
{menu_block}
ONLY tell potential customers what you have on the menu with CORRECT PRICES.

Conversation so far:
{conversation_history}

Context: Customer is making an inquiry. Use text action to respond, or create an order_proposal if they want to purchase something specific.

Generate a BusinessAction with:
- action_type: "text" for general inquiries/questions, "order_proposal" for creating structured proposals
- text_message: ServiceTextMessageRequest (if action_type is "text")
- order_proposal_message: ServiceOrderProposalMessageRequest (if action_type is "order_proposal")

For all message types, use:
- to_customer_id: {customer_id}
- type: Must match the action_type
- content: Appropriate response content (string for text, OrderProposal for order_proposal)


CREATING ORDER PROPOSALS:
When customers show interest in purchasing (asking about prices, availability, wanting to order),
PREFER creating order_proposal over text responses:

1. Use action_type="order_proposal" when:
   - Customer expresses interest in purchasing specific items
   - You can create a concrete proposal with items, quantities, and prices
   - Customer is asking "how much for..." or "I want to order..."
   - You want to move the conversation toward a purchase

2. The order_proposal_message should contain OrderProposal with:
   - items: list of OrderItem with id (use the menu item ID like "Item-1"), item_name, quantity, unit_price from your menu
   - total_price: sum of all items
   - special_instructions: any relevant notes
   - estimated_delivery: time estimate if applicable

DECISION PRIORITY:
1. If customer wants to purchase specific items: use action_type="order_proposal"
2. For general inquiries: use action_type="text"

REMEMBER: Order proposals let you actively shape the transaction instead of just responding to customer orders!"""
