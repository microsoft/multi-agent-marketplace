# Tutorial: magentic-marketplace

This project is a *virtual marketplace simulation* where intelligent AI agents can buy and sell goods. You can create **Customer agents** with specific needs and **Business agents** with products to sell. These agents, powered by *Large Language Models (LLMs)*, autonomously interact with each other through a central **Marketplace Server**. All actions, like sending messages or making purchases, follow a defined **Protocol** and are recorded in a **Database** for later analysis. The entire simulation is managed through a simple *command-line interface*.
